# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Overview

For this project, an unresponsive webpage has been converted to a single mobile-ready web application. It is responsive on different sized displays and should be accessible for screen reader use. It also leverages a service worker to cache the pages for offline use, which should help foster a seamless offline experience for viewers.


## Navigation

The web application itself takes the form of a restaurant reviews page that consists of a landing page followed by a reviews screen. Users can navigate through interactive elements on these pages using the Tab key should they so desire. Images are also ascribed with an 'alt' tag that should provide screen reader users with a verbal description of what is happening is each respective image.
